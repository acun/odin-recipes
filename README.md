# odin-recipes
This is the first project of the Foundations Course of TOP where we use our HTML knowledge to build a basic recipe website.

Our website is an index page that contains links to some recipes. 
Specifically, I wanted to make this website read as a Holotape a player would find roaming Appalachia in Fallout 76. If you'd like to see more of these recipes, visit https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_consumables#Food.

Since we don't utilize CSS at this point, the website looks pretty barebones.
